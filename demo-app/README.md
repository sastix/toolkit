# Demo app
This project demonstrates the usage of restclient and versioning libraries by implementing a demo-app using a client communicating with a server using REST APIs.

This demo-app-server is also using flywaydb, thymeleaf and hibernate. 

In order to properly run the demo-app-server you should have created these directories

/opt/sastix/demoapp/data/


or change the application.properties and logback.xml pointing to folders which exist in your system and you have user r/w rights
